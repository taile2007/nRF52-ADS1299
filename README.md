This firmware is to connect nRF52 (Arm Cortex M4) from Nordic with ADS1299 (TI) - an AFE chip to measure biosignals with multiple channels. The chip is targeted for medical instrument application (EEG and ECG) with high precision (24-bit), simultaneous sampling and multichannel signal acquisition. The data rate
is configurable from 250 SPS to 16 kSPS for all eight channels with CMRR of 110dB.
